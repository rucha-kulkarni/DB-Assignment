1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

-> The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is a one-to-many relationship, where one product can belong to only one product category, but a product category can have multiple products associated with it. This is represented by the "category_id" field in the "Product" table, which serves as a foreign key referencing the "id" field in the "Product_Category" table.

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

-> To ensure that every product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can set up a rule called a foreign key constraint. This rule ensures that the value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table always matches an existing "id" in the "Product_Category" table. It prevents inserting any product with a category that doesn't exist in the category table.
